## 🚀 Why Chatana?

Coding complex features requires more than just a chat window. It needs a more structured workflow. **Chatana** is the visual orchestration layer for the [Claude Code Template](https://github.com/brendankowitz/claude-code-template) workflow.

It transforms the "Feature-First" development lifecycle into an interactive IDE experience. Chatana provides a central **Orchestrator** that:
1.  **Explores & Plans**: Scaffolds features and manages technical investigations.
2.  **Formalizes Decisions**: Helps transition investigations into Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
3.  **Executes & Delegates**: Spawns specialized agents to implement tasks.
4.  **Visualizes Progress**: Manages the entire team on a real-time Kanban board.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **🤖 Intelligent Orchestrator**: The "brain" that drives the Feature-First lifecycle, from exploration to finalization.
*   **👥 Specialized Agent Pool**: Directly integrates agents from the, such as ADR Analyzers and specialized Coding Agents.
*   **📋 Kanban Integration**: Visualizes "User Stories" and tasks as they progress through the workflow.
*   **🔌 MCP-Native**: Built on the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, allowing agents to use existing and built-in MCP tools.
*   **🧠 Persistent Memory**: Agents remember architectural decisions, facts, and "lessons learned" across sessions.
*   **🔒 File Claims System**: Prevents agent conflicts by allowing workers to "claim" files they are actively editing.
*   **📨 Agent-to-Agent Messaging**: Workers coordinate via an internal email-like system, handing off tasks and requesting reviews.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

*   **VS Code**: Version 1.84.0 or higher.
*   **Claude Code CLI**: Installed and authenticated (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`).
*   **Node.js & npm**: Required for building the extension from source.

### Building from Source

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ignixa/chatana.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the extension directory:
    ```bash
    cd src/multi-agent-harness
    ```
3.  Install dependencies and build:
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```
4.  **Launch**: Open the project in VS Code and press `F5` to start the Extension Host.

## 📖 Usage Guide

### 1. Initialize
Open your project folder in the Extension Host window. Run the command:
`Chatana: Initialize Chatana for Project`
This creates the necessary `.chatana` directory for tracking state.

### 2. Start the Orchestrator
Click the **Chatana** icon in the Activity Bar to open the panel. You'll see the Orchestrator chat interface.

### 3. Submit a Task
Type a high-level request.
> "Refactor the authentication service to use JWTs instead of sessions."

### 4. Watch it Work
*   **Plan**: The Orchestrator will analyze your code and propose a plan.
*   **Kanban**: Open the **Kanban Board** (top right icon) to see the created User Stories.
*   **Execution**: Worker agents will spawn, appear in the "Agents" list, and start picking up tickets. You can watch their terminal output and file changes in real-time.

### 5. Review & Complete
As agents finish tasks, they will move cards to "Review" or "Done". You can inspect their changes and provide feedback directly to the Orchestrator.

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can customize Chatana in your VS Code `settings.json`:

| Setting | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `chatana.coordinatorModel` | `sonnet` | Model for the Orchestrator (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku). |
| `chatana.workerModel` | `sonnet` | Model for Worker Agents. |
| `chatana.maxConcurrentAgents` | `5` | Max number of active workers allowed. |
| `chatana.autoReview` | `false` | Automatically spawn a Reviewer agent when tasks complete. |
| `chatana.memory.enabled` | `true` | Enable persistent memory (facts/lessons). |
| `chatana.showClaimsInEditor` | `true` | Show visual indicators for files claimed by agents. |

## 🏗️ Architecture

Chatana is a hybrid VS Code extension + React Webview application.

*   **`src/coordinator/`**: The brain. Contains `OrchestratorAgent.ts` and `AgentPool.ts`.
*   **`src/mcp/`**: The hands. Implementation of MCP servers for Mail, Memory, and Tools.
*   **`src/kanban/`**: The tracker. Logic for the file-based Kanban system (`.chatana/workitems`).
*   **`webview-ui/`**: The face. A React/Vite application that renders the chat, board, and agent views.
