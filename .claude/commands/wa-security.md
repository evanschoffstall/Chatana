# Well-Architected Security Review

Conduct a focused security audit based on the Well-Architected Framework Security pillar:

**Security Pillar Focus Areas:**
- Authentication & Authorization (identity management, RBAC)
- Data Protection (encryption at rest/transit, PII handling)
- Input Validation (SQL injection, XSS, command injection prevention)
- Secrets Management (no hardcoded credentials)
- Security Headers & Configuration

Analyze the codebase for:
- 🚨 Critical security vulnerabilities (hardcoded secrets, SQL injection risks)
- ⚠️ Security weaknesses (missing authorization, weak encryption)
- ✅ Security best practices observed

Provide specific file references and actionable remediation steps.

Use the well-architected-agent with security pillar deep dive scope.
