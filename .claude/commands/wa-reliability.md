# Well-Architected Reliability Review

Conduct a focused reliability assessment based on the Well-Architected Framework Reliability pillar:

**Reliability Pillar Focus Areas:**
- Resilience Patterns (error handling, retry logic, circuit breakers)
- Data Reliability (transaction management, validation, consistency)
- Infrastructure Resilience (health checks, dependency isolation, resource limits)
- Recovery Capabilities (graceful degradation, idempotency)

Analyze the codebase for:
- 🚨 Critical reliability gaps (missing error handling, no retry logic)
- ⚠️ Resilience weaknesses (single points of failure, tight coupling)
- ✅ Reliability best practices observed

Provide specific file references with recommendations for improving system resilience and availability.

Use the well-architected-agent with reliability pillar deep dive scope.
