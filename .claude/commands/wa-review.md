# Well-Architected Framework Review

Conduct a comprehensive architecture and code review based on the Well-Architected Framework's five pillars:

1. **Reliability** - Resiliency, availability, recovery
2. **Security** - Data protection, threat detection, mitigation
3. **Cost Optimization** - Resource efficiency, waste reduction
4. **Operational Excellence** - DevOps practices, observability
5. **Performance Efficiency** - Scalability, performance optimization

Analyze the codebase against all five pillars and provide:
- Critical issues requiring immediate attention
- High-priority recommendations
- Strengths and best practices observed
- Prioritized implementation roadmap
- Specific file references with actionable guidance

Use the well-architected-agent to perform a thorough assessment.
